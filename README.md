## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ricky, and I am a 30 year old native Texan. I currently serve as a police officer and as a Captain in the United States Army Reserves.

I grew up with computers in my hands. Taking them apart, putting them together, and troubleshooting since I was about 5 years old. I have always been fascinated by the tech world and love to know how things work. I recently committed to actually learning
about computer science and programming and have been having a blast. I am currently taking Harvards CS50x and CS50P, and have learned a lot. Eventually I would love to have gathered enough knowledge, skill, and practice to be able to switch careers into
the programming world.

In my down time I love spending time with my wonderful wife and our newborn daughter and play a ton of video games. I'm always open to connect, answer questions, or listen to any advice from those that came before me. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricky-kelley/) and shoot me a message!
